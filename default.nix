  # 2. Builds the rust package set, which contains all crates in your cargo workspace's dependency graph.
  # `makePackageSet'` accepts the following arguments:
  # - `packageFun` (required): The generated `Cargo.nix` file, which returns the whole dependency graph.
  # - `workspaceSrc` (optional): Sources for the workspace can be provided or default to the current directory.
  # - `rustChannel` (required): The Rust channel used to build the package set.
  # - `packageOverrides` (optional):
  #     A function taking a package set and returning a list of overrides.
  #     Overrides are introduced to provide native inputs to build the crates generated in `Cargo.nix`.
  #     See `overlay/lib/overrides.nix` on how to create overrides and `overlay/overrides.nix` for a list of predefined overrides.
  #     Most of the time, you can just use `overrides.all`. You can hand-pick overrides later if your build becomes too slow.
  # - `localPatterns` (optional):
  #     A list of regular expressions that specify what should be included in the sources of your workspace's crates.
  #     The expressions are relative to each crate's manifest directory.
  #     This argument is optional and defaults to include the `src` directory and all `toml` files at the root of the manifest directory.
  # - `rootFeatures` (optional):
  #     A list of activated features on your workspace's crates.
  #     Each feature should be of the form `<crate_name>[/<feature>]`.
  #     If `/<feature>` is omitted, the crate is activated with no default features.
  #     The default behavior is to activate all crates with default features.
  # - `fetchCrateAlternativeRegistry` (optional): A fetcher for crates on alternative registries.
  # - `release` (optional): Whether to enable release mode (equivalent to `cargo build --release`), defaults to `true`.
  # - `hostPlatformCpu` (optional):
  #     Equivalent to rust's target-cpu codegen option. If specified "-Ctarget-cpu=<value>" will be added to the set of rust
  #     flags used for compilation of the package set.
  # - `hostPlatformFeatures` (optional):
  #     Equivalent to rust's target-feature codegen option. If specified "-Ctarget-feature=<values>" will be added to the set of rust
  #     flags used for compilation of the package set. The value should be a list of the features to be turned on, without the leading "+",
  #     e.g. `[ "aes" "sse2" "ssse3" "sse4.1" ]`.  They will be prefixed with a "+", and comma delimited before passing through to rust.
  #     Crates that check for CPU features such as the `aes` crate will be evaluated against this argument.
