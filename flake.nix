        # 2. Builds the rust package set, which contains all crates in your cargo workspace's dependency graph.
        # `makePackageSet'` accepts the following arguments:
        # - `packageFun` (required): The generated `Cargo.nix` file, which returns the whole dependency graph.
        # - `workspaceSrc` (optional): Sources for the workspace can be provided or default to the current directory.
        # - `rustChannel` (required): The Rust channel used to build the package set.
        # - `packageOverrides` (optional):
        #     A function taking a package set and returning a list of overrides.
        #     Overrides are introduced to provide native inputs to build the crates generated in `Cargo.nix`.
        #     See `overlay/lib/overrides.nix` on how to create overrides and `overlay/overrides.nix` for a list of predefined overrides.
        #     Most of the time, you can just use `overrides.all`. You can hand-pick overrides later if your build becomes too slow.
        # - `rootFeatures` (optional):
        #     A list of activated features on your workspace's crates.
        #     Each feature should be of the form `<crate_name>[/<feature>]`.
        #     If `/<feature>` is omitted, the crate is activated with no default features.
        #     The default behavior is to activate all crates with default features.
        # - `fetchCrateAlternativeRegistry` (optional): A fetcher for crates on alternative registries.
        # - `release` (optional): Whether to enable release mode (equivalent to `cargo build --release`), defaults to `true`.
        # - `hostPlatformCpu` (optional):
        #     Equivalent to rust's target-cpu codegen option. If specified "-Ctarget-cpu=<value>" will be added to the set of rust
        #     flags used for compilation of the package set.
        # - `hostPlatformFeatures` (optional):
        #     Equivalent to rust's target-feature codegen option. If specified "-Ctarget-feature=<values>" will be added to the set of rust
        #     flags used for compilation of the package set. The value should be a list of the features to be turned on, without the leading "+",
        #     e.g. `[ "aes" "sse2" "ssse3" "sse4.1" ]`.  They will be prefixed with a "+", and comma delimited before passing through to rust.
        #     Crates that check for CPU features such as the `aes` crate will be evaluated against this argument.
        # - `target` (optional):
        #     Set an explicit Rust output target.  Overrides the translation
        #     from Nix targets to Rust targets.  See overlay/lib/rust-triple.nix
        #     for more info.
