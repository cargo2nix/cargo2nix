# rust crate in the entire workspace.  However, if we naively pass all rust
# crates to inputsFrom, many dependencies will be duplicated via propagation or
# multiple inclusion.  Therefore, instead create the dependency sets from the
# rust crates are collected and de-duplicated before passing them to the normal
# mkShell.  This is also done for the shellHook, just slightly differently.  The
# source is really similar to nixpkgs mkShell that it decorates, so study one
# and understand both.
